### 数据授权范围越权漏洞;
The problem is that the contract is not restricted on the operation scope, allowing the user to execute operations beyond their permissions.;
;
The contract should have a specific scope for each address, which prevents users from performing operations beyond their permissions.;

### 数据所有权伪造漏洞;
The problem is that the contract allows for the creation of fake ownership records.;
;
The contract should verify the validity of the ownership records before creating them.;
