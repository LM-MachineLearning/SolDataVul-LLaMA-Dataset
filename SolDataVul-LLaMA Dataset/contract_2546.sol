Vulnerability 1: ShortAddress;
The vulnerability occurs when the `transfer` function is called with a short address. The `to.length` check is not performed, allowing a short address to be used. However, the contract checks that the address is of length 42. To fix this, check if the address is 40 characters long.;

Vulnerability 2: Authorization;
The vulnerability occurs when a user calls the `transfer` function with their own address. The contract checks if the user is authorized or not. However, the function can be called with a user's address as the `to` parameter, which would allow the user to transfer funds from any other address. To fix this, check if the `to` address is the same as the `msg.sender`.;

Vulnerability 3: Re-entrancy;
The vulnerability occurs when a user calls the `transfer` function multiple times with the same address as the `to` parameter. The contract checks if the `to` address is currently being re-entered. However, if the `to` address is the same as the `msg.sender`, the function can be called again, allowing the user to re-enter the contract multiple times. To fix this, check if the `to` address is the same as the `msg.sender`.;
