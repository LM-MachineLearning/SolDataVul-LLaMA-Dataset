**Data Disclosure Vulnerability**;
* **Description:** An attacker can obtain sensitive information from the mapping `requestToVrfHashes`, which contains the VRF proof hashes of a request. If an attacker can obtain the hashes from the mapping, they can potentially derive the solution of the VRF.;
* **Attack:** An attacker can use a brute-force approach to solve the VRF using the hashes obtained from the mapping.;
* **Solution:** Add an access control to the mapping. Restrict the access to the mapping to only the sequencer and the proposed sequencer.;
**Vulnerability:**;
* `mapping(uint256 id => bytes10[2] vrfHashes) requestToVrfHashes;`;
**Solution:**;
* `mapping(uint256 id => bytes10[2] vrfHashes) requestToVrfHashes;
**Data Disclosure Vulnerability**;
* **Description:** An attacker can obtain sensitive information from the mapping `ethReserved`, which contains the reserved ETH for a specific client. If an attacker can obtain the information from the mapping, they can potentially use it to manipulate the clientâ€™s balance or steal the ETH.;
* **Attack:** An attacker can use the information to steal the ETH.;
* **Solution:** Add an access control to the mapping. Restrict the access to the mapping to only the sequencer and the proposed sequencer.;
**Vulnerability:**;
* `mapping(address client => uint256 reserved) ethReserved;`;
**Solution:**;
* `mapping(address client => uint256 reserved) ethReserved;
**Data Disclosure Vulnerability**;
* **Description:** An attacker can obtain sensitive information from the mapping `beaconIndex`, which contains the index of a beacon. If an attacker can obtain the information from the mapping, they can potentially steal the data from the beacon.;
* **Attack:** An attacker can use the information to steal the data from the beacon.;
* **Solution:** Add an access control to the mapping. Restrict the access to the mapping to only the sequencer and the proposed sequencer.;
**Vulnerability:**;
* `mapping(address beacon => uint256 index) beaconIndex;`;
**Solution:**;
* `mapping(address beacon => uint256 index) beaconIndex;
**Data Disclosure Vulnerability**;
* **Description:** An attacker can obtain sensitive information from the mapping `ethCollateral`, which contains the collateral ETH for a specific beacon. If an attacker can obtain the information from the mapping, they can potentially steal the ETH.;
* **Attack:** An attacker can use the information to steal the ETH.;
* **Solution:
