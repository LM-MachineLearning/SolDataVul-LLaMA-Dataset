### Solution;
;
### Note;
The short address attack can be injected in `setPrice` function.;
The short address attack is a type of attack that happens when contracts do not verify the validity of the input addresses. The attacker can use the short address attack to send the funds to the wrong address.;
The vulnerability can be exploited by creating a short address, which is a short address that is used to represent an address on the Ethereum blockchain. The short address can be used to perform a variety of attacks, such as the short address attack.;
The short address attack exploits the fact that contracts do not verify the validity of the input addresses. Because of this, the address of the sender can be easily manipulated, allowing an attacker to send funds to a different address. The short address attack can also be used to steal funds from contracts.;
To prevent the short address attack, contracts should always verify the validity of the input addresses.
function sendETH(address recipient, uint256 value) public {
    (bool ok, ) = address(bytes20(recipient)).call{value: value}(abi.encodePacked("data"));
    require(ok)}
