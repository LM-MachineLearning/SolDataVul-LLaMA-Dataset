### 2.3. Exploit the vulnerabilities and analyze the impact (Optional);
Now let's analyze the impact of these two vulnerabilities.;
#### 2.3.1. Strict balance check vulnerability;
The strict balance check vulnerability happens when the contract checks whether the balance of the sender is greater than the value of the data asset. The contract then checks whether the balance of the sender is greater than the balance of the current owner. This vulnerability is only a problem when the balance of the current owner is greater than the balance of the sender.;
The impact of this vulnerability is that a user can exploit this vulnerability to gain control of the data asset by paying more than the current owner's balance, which can result in a data loss or unauthorized access to the data asset.;
#### 2.3.2. Data ownership forgery vulnerability;
The data ownership forgery vulnerability happens when the contract allows the address of the current owner to be forged or altered, resulting in unauthorized access to the data asset. The vulnerability is only a problem when the address of the current owner is not verified or trustworthy.;
The impact of this vulnerability is that a malicious actor can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the data asset and potentially steal or misuse the data.;
### 2.4. Fix the vulnerabilities and analyze the impact;
Now let's fix the vulnerabilities.;
#### 2.4.1. Strict balance check vulnerability;
The fixed contract is as follows:;
;
The impact of this fix is that the contract can now distinguish between legitimate data registrations and attempted data registrations that exceed the current owner's balance. This fix solves the strict balance check vulnerability and prevents unauthorized data registrations.;
#### 2.4.2. Data ownership forgery vulnerability;
The fixed contract is as follows:;
;
The impact of this fix is that the contract can now verify the validity of the data asset ownership information. This fix solves the data ownership forgery vulnerability and prevents unauthorized access to the data asset.;
### 2.5. Test the fixed 
Now let's test the fixed contract to see if the vulnerabilities have been fixed.;
#### 2.5.1. Test the strict balance check vulnerability fix;
Let's first test the contract with the original vulnerable code.;
1. Deploy the contract.;
2. Send 0.0001 ether to the contract address.;
3. Try to register the same data asset again.;
;
The result should be:;
;
#### 2.5.2. Test the data ownership forgery vulnerability fix;
Now let's test the contract with the fixed code.;
1. Deploy the contract.;
2. Send 0.0001 ether to the contract address.;
3. Try to register the same data asset again.;
;
The result should be:;
;
## 3. Conclusion;
In this tutorial, we have learned how to inject vulnerabilities into a smart contract and analyze their impact. We have also learned how to fix vulnerabilities by writing the Solidity code.;
Please keep in mind that this is a simplified example for the purpose of illustration. In a real-world scenario, you should take extra steps to ensure the security of your contract and the data it stores.;
