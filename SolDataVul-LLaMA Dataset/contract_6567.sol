### Task 6: Implement a New Feature for Decentralized Trust Score
You are a senior blockchain security auditor and expert Solidity engineer.
Your task is to implement a new feature for Decentralized Trust Score.
Your task is to create a feature that allows any user to create a trust score for another user.
Your new feature should be secure.
The contract should be auditable.
The contract should be immutable.
The contract should be upgradable.
The contract should be deployable.
The contract should be verifiable.
The contract should be secure.
You can only insert code into the existing function.
You can add a new function.
You should output a solidity contract with the new feature.
