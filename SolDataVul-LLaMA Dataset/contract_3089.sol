1. The `IController` interface contract is not used in the contract, but it is used as an input to the constructor. However, the `IController` interface contract has no constructor and no `fallback` function, which can lead to a `revert()` in the constructor.;
2. The `priceOracle()` function is only called inside a function and there is no `revert()` in it. But if the price oracle has a `revert()` function, it will revert if there is an error.;
Solution:;

function depositETH(address payable locker) public {
    (bool sent, ) = locker.call{value: 1 ether}("");
    require(sent)}
