### Part 1. Timestamp Dependence Vulnerability;
The `buy` function relies on the `oracle.getTimestampsOfLastUploads` function to check whether the data of the tokens has been uploaded recently enough. To make this function work, the contract requires that the timestamps of the latest data uploads of all tokens must be equal to or greater than the current block timestamp minus 1 day. This is a vulnerability because the current block timestamp can be manipulated by the attacker.;
A malicious actor can inject a fake block with a modified timestamp, making the timestamp check fail. This would allow the attacker to buy any token at a very low price, effectively causing the price to go down.;
To fix the vulnerability, we can use a median-of-three sample instead of a simple minimum. This can be done by modifying the `min` function used in the `buy` function as follows:;
;
With this modification, the `buy` function becomes:;
```solidity;
function buy(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts);
    external;
{
    require(tokens.length == amounts.length, "Must be equal lengths");
    uint256[] memory timestamps = oracle.getTimestampsOfLastUploads(tokens);
    require(
        timestamps.length == tokens.length,
        "Number of timestamps must be equal to number of tokens",
    );
    uint256 medianTimestamp = min(timestamps[0], timestamps[1], timestamps[2]);
    require(
        block.timestamp - medianTimestamp >= TIMESTAMP_WINDOW,
        "Timestamp window is not satisfied",
    );
    bool[] memory isValidValue = oracle.getData(tokens);
    require(
        isValidValue[0],
        "Timestamp must be greater than the latest data upload timestamp",
    );
    uint256
function expireOrder() public {
    if (block.timestamp > orderExpiry) {
        cancelOrder()}
