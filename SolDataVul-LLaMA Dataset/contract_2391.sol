// Injected data-trading logic
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
contract DataContract {

    function grantAccessToData(address requester, string memory dataId) public {
        emit AccessGranted(requester, dataId);
    }
}

The injected vulnerabilities should be in a form of logical statements, not only injecting the vulnerability code. For example, instead of just injecting the vulnerability code into the contract, you should also inject a check that the user is not the attacker.;
Here is an example of how to inject the vulnerability into the contract:;

library EnumerableMap {
function bet() public {
    require(block.timestamp % 2 == 0, "Unfair time-based logic")}
