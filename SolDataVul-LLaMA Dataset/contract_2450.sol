Note:;
The vulnerability `reentrancy attack` can be injected into the contract source code to make the contract susceptible to the reentrancy attack.;
The vulnerability `transaction malleability` cannot be injected into the contract source code directly, as it requires a specific transaction format and can only be applied through a blockchain wallet.;
The vulnerability `front-running attack` cannot be injected into the contract source code, as it requires a specific transaction order and can only be applied through a blockchain wallet.;
The vulnerability `timestamp manipulation` cannot be injected into the contract source code, as it requires a specific transaction format and can only be applied through a blockchain wallet.;
The vulnerability `denial of service` cannot be injected into the contract source code, as it requires a specific attack mechanism and can only be applied through a blockchain wallet.
