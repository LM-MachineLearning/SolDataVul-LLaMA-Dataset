## 1. Replay attack;
### 1.1. Timestamp manipulation;
This vulnerability occurs when the timestamp of the blockchain is manipulated, allowing an attacker to replay a transaction with a valid signature.;
In the `Miscalculation` contract, we have a `price()` function that returns the price after subtracting the discount. We can manipulate the timestamp of the blockchain to make the transaction be included in a block at a specific timestamp. The attacker will sign the transaction with the private key, but the timestamp will not match the public transaction timestamp. This will cause the transaction to be included in the block at a different time than when it was originally sent.;
The `Calculation` contract does not have this issue because it has a timestamp verification at the beginning of the function.;
### 1.2. Nonce manipulation;
In the `Miscalculation` contract, we have a nonce manipulation vulnerability that allows an attacker to replay a transaction that has been signed multiple times. A nonce is a random number that is used to prevent replay attacks. In the `price()` function, we use the nonce to ensure that each transaction has a unique nonce. However, if the attacker is able to manipulate the nonce in the transaction, they will be able to replay the transaction multiple times.;
In the `Calculation` contract, we do not have nonce manipulation vulnerability because we have a nonce verification at the beginning of the function.;
## 2. Permission control;
### 2.1. Unauthorized access;
In the `Miscalculation` contract, we have an unauthorized access vulnerability that allows an attacker to access sensitive data and perform operations that are not intended for them.;
In the `price()` function, the `Calculation` contract has a check for the caller to be the owner of the contract. The `Miscalculation` contract does not have this check, allowing any user to call the `price
function replayableTransfer1(address to) public {
    payable(to).transfer(1 ether)}
function setPrice(uint newPrice) public {
    price = newPrice}
