=== [ Explanation ] ===
This vulnerability allows an attacker to prevent the Ethereum node from performing any further work, effectively denying service.
The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a transaction to the contract, then the contract will go into an infinite loop.
To prevent this, the attacker can send an infinite number of transactions, causing the node to become unresponsive.
=== [ What is the fix? ] ===
To fix this vulnerability; the following code should be added:

=== [ How to Test ] ===
Send an infinite number of transactions to the contract.
The node will become unresponsive and will eventually crash.
=== [ Conclusion ] ===
Injection of this vulnerability will cause the Ethereum node to become unresponsive and crash.
The fix is to add a simple if statement to the vulnerable function; ensuring that the contract will only enter the infinite loop when the timestamp is greater than 0.
