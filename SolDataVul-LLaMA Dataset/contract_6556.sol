=== [ Answer ] ===

=== [ Explanation ] ===
The `balances[msg.sender]` line in the vulnerable contract is susceptible to reentrancy attacks.
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could call `withdrawReplay` in a loop,
leveraging the fact that the contract does not have a nonce or a flag to prevent reentrancy.
The exploit can be as simple as the following:

In this exploit, we first call `withdrawReplay` to withdraw all of the balance associated with our address.
We then set the balance back to 0, allowing the next call to `withdrawReplay` to be executed successfully.
The replay attack is executed in a loop, exploiting the fact that the contract does not have a nonce or a flag to prevent reentrancy.
The attacker can send unlimited Ether to the  causing the balance to become 0; and then withdraw the entire balance again.
It is recommended to use a nonce or a flag to prevent reentrancy attacks to prevent this vulnerability.
