### 1. Short Address Attack;
This vulnerability requires the contract to allow receiving Ether and to not perform any validation on the incoming Ether transactions. The attacker can then send a small amount of Ether to the contract address, which will then be considered as a valid transaction.;
To fix this vulnerability, we need to add a check to make sure that the incoming Ether transactions are valid. We can do this by calling the `require` function.;

    (bool ok, ) = address(bytes20(recipient)).call{value: value}(abi.encodePacked("data"));
