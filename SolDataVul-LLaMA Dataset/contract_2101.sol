## Attack;
### 1. Reentrancy;
[Reentrancy](https:
* `require(initializing || isConstructor() || !initialized, "Contract instance has already been initialized");`: This statement only prevents reentrancy from the constructor. But the fallback function can still be reentrant.;
* `bool isTopLevelCall = !initializing; if (isTopLevelCall) { initializing = true; initialized = true} _; if (isTopLevelCall) { initializing = false}`: This statement only prevents reentrancy from the fallback function; but it will not block reentrancy from `isConstructor()` or the constructor.;
To solve this, we need to add a variable `bool private _initializing;` and use it to determine whether a function is being called from the constructor or not.;

### 2. Ether being locked forever;
[Ether being locked forever](https:
* `uint256[50] private ______gap,`: This is an empty array. If it contains a large amount of Ether, it will not be able to send Ether to other contracts.,
* `uint256[50] private ______gap,`: This is an empty array. If it contains a large amount of Ether, it will not be able to send Ether to other contracts.,
To solve this, we need to add a function to transfer the Ether to the specified address.,
,
### 3. Unprotected functions,
[Unprotected functions](https:
* `modifier initializer() {`: This modifier is not protected.;
* `isConstructor() private view returns (bool) {`: This function is not protected.;
To solve this, we need to use a guard modifier to ensure that the function is being called by
function depositETH(address payable locker) public {
    (bool sent, ) = locker.call{value: 1 ether}("");
    require(sent)}
