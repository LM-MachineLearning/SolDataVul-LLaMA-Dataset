1. Time stamp dependency vulnerability: It is a timestamp-dependent vulnerability, which occurs when the contract relies on the block timestamp to decide the critical operations, such as the validity of a transaction or the validity of a data. The vulnerability can be exploited by the attacker to manipulate the time stamp, which may cause the contract to behave in an unintended manner, such as the attacker can manipulate the contract to make the transaction unsuccessful or the data to be unverified.;
2. Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability: It is a DoS vulnerability, which enables the attacker to exhaust the computational resources of the contract, causing it to be unable to respond to the legitimate usersâ€™ requests. In data trading, the malicious user can exploit this vulnerability to prevent the legitimate users from submitting transactions or verifying data, leading to a complete disruption of the data trading service.;
