## Vulnerability 1;
The contract can be initialized only once. If a non-initializer tries to initialize a contract again, it will revert with the `ErrorAlreadyInitialized` error. This is great, but how can we make it better? How can we make it possible for another contract to initialize this contract?;
The solution is to add a public initializer function.;
;
## Vulnerability 2;
The nonce mapping is used to prevent replay attacks. If an attacker sends a request with the same nonce again, the request will be rejected. However, this can be bypassed by using a different nonce for each request.;
The solution is to add a counter to the nonce mapping.;
;
;
## Vulnerability 3;
The timestamp mapping is used to prevent replay attacks. If an attacker sends a request with an old timestamp, the request will be rejected. However, this can be bypassed by using a different timestamp for each request.;
The solution is to add a counter to the timestamp mapping.;
;
;
## Vulnerability 4;
The balance mapping is used to store the balance of an account. However, it is vulnerable to reentrancy attack. If an account sends a payment to a contract that calls `transfer`, the contract can call `transfer` again and cause a reentrancy attack. The attacker can use this to steal the user's balance and make the contract owner lose the balance.;
The solution is to add a reentrancy lock.;
;
;
## Vulnerability 5;
The authorized mapping is used to store the permission of an account. However, it is vulnerable to authorization attacks. If an attacker has the permission to perform a critical operation, they can perform the operation without the permission. The attacker can use this to steal the user's balance and make the contract owner lose the balance.;
The solution is to add a reentrancy lock.;
