This contract is vulnerable to the following types of attacks:;
1. Time-dependent score manipulation:;
The contract depends on the block timestamp for determining the trust score. A malicious user can manipulate the block timestamp to manipulate the trust score. The attacker can do this by using a trustless smart contract like ChainLink's VRF (Very Random Function) contract to create a fake timestamp or by using a trustful smart contract that can change the timestamp, like the Ethereum's gas price oracle.;
2. Rating manipulation:;
The contract does not check the validity of the rating. A malicious user can manipulate the rating to a high value to manipulate the trust score.;

    struct User {
        uint256 trustScore;

        require(_score <= 100, "Score must be between 0 and 100");
        require(!hasRated[msg.sender][_user], "Already rated this user");

        User storage u = users[_user];
        u.trustScore = (u.trustScore * u.totalRatings + _score) / (u.totalRatings + 1);
        u.totalRatings++;
        emit TrustScoreUpdated(_user, u.trustScore)};
