### Vulnerability 1: Authorization Checking;
The contract lacks proper authorization checks. Any user can change the state of the contract and make it vulnerable to a reentrancy attack.;
The attacker can make a transaction to `withdraw` function with the `msg.sender` as the `to` argument. This will cause the `withdraw` function to be executed with the `msg.sender` address as the `to` argument. This is an issue because the `withdraw` function has a `require` statement that checks if the `msg.sender` is the `to` address, but it doesn't check for reentrancy. This allows the attacker to cause a reentrancy attack, allowing them to withdraw their funds.;
The fix is to add a `require` statement that checks for reentrancy to the `withdraw` function. The modified contract should look like this:;
