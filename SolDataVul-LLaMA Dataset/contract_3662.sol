**Vulnerability 1: Authority Scope Escalation**;
**Vulnerability Description**: In this vulnerability, an attacker can escalate their authority scope by exploiting a bug in the `RequestData.Role` field. The bug is that the role ID is not properly validated, allowing an attacker to set an arbitrary role ID. As a result, the attacker can then manipulate the `RequestData.Role` field to grant themselves authority over any role in the system, including those they do not have access to.;
**Injection Point**: Inject the vulnerability in the `RequestData` struct, in the `role` field.;
**Code Injection**:;
;
**Vulnerability 2: Timestamp Tampering**;
**Vulnerability Description**: In this vulnerability, an attacker can manipulate the time stamp of a `RequestData` to manipulate the contract's state. By doing so, an attacker can alter the state of the contract, potentially leading to data tampering, unauthorized updates, or even full chain rewrites.;
**Injection Point**: Inject the vulnerability in the `RequestData` struct, in the `epoch` field.;
