### 2. Inject Timestamp Manipulation Vulnerability (Solution);
The timestamp manipulation vulnerability occurs when the contract relies on block timestamp to decide key actions. The attacker can manipulate the block timestamp to manipulate the outcome of key actions.;
The injection is done by adding a statement that allows the attacker to manipulate the block timestamp.;
;
### 3. Inject Transaction Non-Tracability Vulnerability (Solution);
The transaction non-tracability vulnerability occurs when the contract does not keep transaction path or log. The attacker can not trace the transaction.;
The injection is done by adding a statement that uses event to keep track of the transaction and trace the transaction.;
;
### 4. Inject Short Address Attack Vulnerability (Solution);
The short address attack vulnerability occurs when the contract does not validate the input address. The attacker can manipulate the input address to make the transaction.;
The injection is done by adding a statement that uses address.check() to validate the address.;
