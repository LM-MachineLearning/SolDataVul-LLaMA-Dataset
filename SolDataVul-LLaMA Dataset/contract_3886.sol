### Solution;
* Data Leakage: `ErrorNotDelegated`;
* Transaction Non-Traceability: `ErrorCannotRemoveNotPermanentApprover`;
* Permission Control: `ErrorApproverOrHeadOrGovOnly`;
1. Data Leakage;
The vulnerability is located in `ErrorNotDelegated` error, which is thrown when an address is not a valid approver.;
;
2. Transaction Non-Traceability;
The vulnerability is located in `ErrorCannotRemoveNotPermanentApprover` error, which is thrown when an address tries to remove a non-permanent approver.;
;
3. Permission Control;
The vulnerability is located in `ErrorApproverOrHeadOrGovOnly` error, which is thrown when an address tries to delegate a permanent approver.;
