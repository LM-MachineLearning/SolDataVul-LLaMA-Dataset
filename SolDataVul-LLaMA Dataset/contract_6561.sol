=== [ Additional Information ] ===
This vulnerability was discovered through a fuzzing process where random sequences of characters were input into the contract's transferTo function. A 100% accuracy rate was achieved during the fuzzing process.
=== [ Vulnerability Description ] ===
短地址攻击: 短地址攻击是指短地址在合约中被恶意使用，以攻击合约的安全性。
短地址的短地址可以在合约中被短地址攻击，从而触发合约的错误行为，或者获得合约中的权限，或者对合约进行篡改。
短地址攻击的攻击者可以在合约中通过短地址触发短地址攻击，从而使合约陷入安全隐患。
短地址攻击的缓解措施包括：
1. 地址完整性检查
2. 短地址限制
3. 合约访问控制
