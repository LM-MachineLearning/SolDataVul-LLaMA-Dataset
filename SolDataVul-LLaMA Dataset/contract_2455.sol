 * Vulnerability: re-entrancy;
 *;
 * In this contract, `arbBlockHash` and `arbBlockNumber` are exposed as publicly readable functions,;
 * which could be called by any user to perform a re-entrancy attack.;
 *;
 * A re-entrancy attack is a type of attack that exploits the uncontrolled recursion of a function,;
 * allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the function, potentially leading to a;
 * denial of service.;
 *;
 * To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to call `arbBlockHash` or `arbBlockNumber`;
 * repeatedly, until the stack size is exhausted, at which point the function will enter an infinite;
 * loop, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.;
 *;
 * The vulnerability can be mitigated by making these functions internal, or by only allowing;
 * trusted actors to call them.;

 * Vulnerability: force cast;
 *;
 * In this contract, `arbBlockHash` and `arbBlockNumber` are exposed as publicly readable functions,;
 * which could be called by any user to perform a force cast attack.;
 *;
 * A force cast attack is a type of attack that exploits the use of force casting, which can be used;
 * to bypass type restrictions and execute arbitrary code.;
 *;
 * To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to call `arbBlockHash` or `arbBlockNumber`;
 * with a maliciously crafted input, potentially leading to a force cast.;
