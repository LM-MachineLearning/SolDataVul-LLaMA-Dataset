### 赋值漏洞;
The assignment vulnerability occurs when the vulnerability-prone data is directly or indirectly assigned to an external variable or contract variable, allowing the attacker to manipulate the data before it is validated. In this vulnerability, the attacker can manipulate the value of the variable before it is validated, allowing them to manipulate the value of the variable and potentially bypass the validation rule.;
For example, in the provided contract, the vulnerability-prone data is directly assigned to the `approvedValue` variable. The vulnerability occurs when the value of the `approvedValue` variable is assigned to an external variable or contract variable. The attacker can manipulate the value of the `approvedValue` variable before it is validated, allowing them to manipulate the value of the external variable or contract variable and potentially bypass the validation rule.;
To fix this vulnerability, the attacker must be able to manipulate the value of the external variable or contract variable directly or indirectly. This requires the attacker to have access to the external variable or contract variable and be able to manipulate the value of the variable directly or indirectly.;
To fix this vulnerability, you need to add a new variable that stores the value of the vulnerability-prone data, and then use a function to validate the value of this variable. The function should be called before the value is assigned to the external variable or contract variable.;
Contract source code:;

;
interface IRequestsManagerBase is IRequestsTypes {
  struct Approval {
    address approver;
    uint64 approvedValue};
  error ErrorRequestIsCanceled();
  error ErrorTooManyHours(uint countHours, uint maxAllowedValue)};

### 拒绝服务漏洞;
The DoS vulnerability occurs when an external contract or variable is modified or manipulated by an external entity, causing the contract to behave in an unintended manner. In this vulnerability, the attacker can manipulate the value of the variable directly or indirectly, causing the contract to crash or behave abnormally.;
