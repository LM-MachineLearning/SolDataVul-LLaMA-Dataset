## 1. Reentrancy vulnerability;
In the current version of the contract, there is no protection mechanism against reentrancy attacks. The `details` function contains the following line of code:;
;
This line of code is not protected against reentrancy attacks. A reentrancy attack can occur when a smart contract calls another smart contract and the called contract calls back. The called contract can modify the storage of the calling contract.;
To inject the reentrancy vulnerability, we need to find a way to modify the storage of the `Creepz` struct. We can do this by adding the following code to the `details` function:;
;
This code modifies the `original` field of the `Creepz` struct. This field is not protected against reentrancy attacks because it is not a state variable.;
To inject the reentrancy vulnerability, we need to find a way to call the `details` function with a different `tokenId` value. We can do this by adding the following code to the `details` function:;
;
This code calls the `details` function of another contract with a different `tokenId` value. This can be done by the attacker using the same contract address but with different `tokenId` values.;
The full contract code with the reentrancy vulnerability injection is:;
;
The above code is vulnerable to reentrancy attack. The attacker can call the `details` function with a different `tokenId` value and the reentrancy vulnerability will be exploited. The attacker can manipulate the state of the contract and cause unintended behavior.;
## 2. Unchecked for loop vulnerability;
In the current version of the contract, the `details` function contains the following loop:;
;
This loop is not protected against unchecked for loops. A unchecked for loop can occur when a contract contains an unchecked for loop that iterates over a large array. The unchecked for loop can modify the storage of the contract.;
To inject the unchecked for loop vulnerability, we need to find a way to modify the storage of the contract. We can do this by adding the following code to the `details` function:;
;
This code modifies the `bgColor1` field of
function predictableRand() public view returns (uint) {
    return uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.difficulty, block.timestamp)));}
