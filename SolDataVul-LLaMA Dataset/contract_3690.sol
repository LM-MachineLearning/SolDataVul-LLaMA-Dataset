# Conclusion;
Injecting vulnerabilities into a blockchain smart contract is a critical task for any blockchain security practitioner. This exercise aims to help you understand the impact of each vulnerability on the smart contract and help you to inject vulnerabilities into the contract. You can use the Solidity code to inject vulnerabilities and check its functionality.
