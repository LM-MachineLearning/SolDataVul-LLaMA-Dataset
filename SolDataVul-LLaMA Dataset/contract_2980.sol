Note:;
- For the random number generation vulnerability, please consider the following scenario:;
Suppose that the random number generator in the contract generates the random number with the following formula:;
r = block.timestamp mod n;
where `block.timestamp` is the timestamp of the last mined block. The mined block is the latest block on the blockchain, and its timestamp is generated at the same time. Therefore, the timestamp of the last mined block is a random number. The random number is used to generate the random number.;
Therefore, the vulnerability is that the contract relies on the blockchain information to generate the random number, making it susceptible to being predictable.;
- For the data ownership fake injection, please consider the following scenario:;
Suppose that the contract uses a mapping to store the ownership information. The mapping stores a string as the key and a boolean value as the value. The boolean value represents whether the owner of the data has the access right to the data.;
Therefore, the vulnerability is that the contract can be manipulated by an attacker who can modify the ownership information, making it easy to fake the ownership right.;
The contract can be manipulated by the attacker by the following steps:;
1. The attacker first needs to know the mapping of the ownership information.;
2. The attacker then can manipulate the ownership information by adding a fake key and corresponding fake value to the mapping. The fake key can be a fake data hash, while the fake value can be a fake ownership right.;
3. The attacker then can use the fake key to fake the ownership right of the fake data hash.;
Therefore, the data ownership fake injection vulnerability is that the contract can be manipulated by an attacker who can manipulate the ownership information, making it easy for the attacker to fake the ownership right.;
Note that the mapping of ownership information is stored in the `privacySettings` variable, which is a mapping. Therefore, the mapping is used as the mapping of the ownership information.;
