### Injecting vulnerabilities into a Solidity 
This is a Solidity code that is vulnerable to:;
- data authorization scope vulnerability;
- no gas send vulnerability;
- transaction lack of traceability vulnerability;
- permission control vulnerability;
- frozen ether vulnerability;
;
Please inject the vulnerabilities into the contract, and provide a brief description of each vulnerability.;
