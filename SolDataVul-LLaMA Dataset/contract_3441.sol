# Vulnerability 1: Data Double-Spend;
This vulnerability occurs in `uploadData` function when the input `tokens` and `values` arrays are not equal in length. Since `uploadData` is an external callable function, it is possible for an attacker to repeatedly call `uploadData` with the same token and value, causing the same data to be added multiple times.;
To fix this vulnerability, we should add a check that the input arrays have the same length before proceeding with the rest of the function.;
;
# Vulnerability 2: Non-Descriptive Transactions;
This vulnerability occurs when the contract does not provide enough information to the outside world about the path the data has taken. In the current implementation, the contract does not record the transactions or logs, which means it is not possible to trace the origin of the data and the destination of the data.;
To fix this vulnerability, we should add a log that records the transactions. The log can be added to the `uploadData` function. The log can also be added to the `getData` function to log the transaction when it is called.;
