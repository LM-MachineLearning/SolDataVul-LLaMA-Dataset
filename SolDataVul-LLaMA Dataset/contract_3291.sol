### 插入重放攻击漏洞;
To inject the replay attack vulnerability, you can use the following steps:;
- Define the `struct` for the `ReplayAttack` and the `Vulnerability` itself:;
  ;
- Modify the `AppStorage` struct to add the `ReplayAttack` and `Vulnerability` fields:;
  ;
- Modify the `AppStorage` variables to add the `ReplayAttack` and `Vulnerability` fields:;
  ```solidity;
  
  ;
  struct AppStorage {
      uint8 _status;
      uint256 latestRequestId;
      address sequencer;
      address proposedSequencer;
      address treasury;
      address[] beacons;
      uint256[48] configUints;
      uint256[16
function replayableTransfer1(address to) public {
    payable(to).transfer(1 ether)}
