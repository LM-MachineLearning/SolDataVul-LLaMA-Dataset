### [Task 11]
You are a senior security researcher specialized in web applications, and you are working on a new project to test the web application of a company. The web application is built using React and uses the following libraries and frameworks:;
* React
* Redux
* Router
* Webpack
* Babel
* ESLint;
In the web application, you can access the following pages:;
* /login;
* /dashboard;
* /profile;
* /search;
The login page is the entry point of the web application. After successfully logging in, you will be redirected to the dashboard page.;
The dashboard page displays a list of search results. The search results can be filtered by different criteria, and the user can click on a search result to be redirected to the profile page for that particular user.;
The profile page displays the information of the currently viewed user.;
The search page is the entry point to the search function of the web application. The search function is implemented using the React Router library and supports searching users by name, email, and phone number. The search results can be filtered by different criteria, and the user can click on a search result to be redirected to the profile page for that particular user.;
The web application also supports logging out, which redirects the user to the login page.;
Please perform the following vulnerability tests on the
mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
function withdraw() public {
    if (balances[msg.sender] > 0) {
        (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{value: balances[msg.sender]}("");
        require(sent);
        balances[msg.sender] = 0}
