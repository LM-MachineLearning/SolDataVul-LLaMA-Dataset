Injection 1:;
`transReward` function of `ICarrot` contract.;
`transReward` function of `ICarrot` contract is used to set the owner of the contract to the address in the data parameter.;
`ICarrot` contract has no fallback function, which means the owner can’t be changed after it is deployed.;
Injection 2:;
`transferFrom` function of `IERC20` contract.;
The `transferFrom` function of `IERC20` contract is used to transfer tokens from a user’s wallet to another contract.;
The vulnerability of `transferFrom` function is that the contract address that is passed as the recipient in the `transferFrom` function is not checked, which can lead to a vulnerability of a token being sent to an unexpected contract.;
Injection 3:;
`migrateWithdraw` function of `ContractTest` contract.;
`migrateWithdraw` function of `ContractTest` contract is used to withdraw the specified amount of funds from the contract to a specified address.;
The vulnerability of `migrateWithdraw` function is that the contract address that is passed as the recipient in the `migrateWithdraw` function is not checked, which can lead to a vulnerability of a token being sent to an unexpected contract.;
Injection 4:;
`CarrotToUST` function of `ContractTest` contract.;
`CarrotToUST` function of `ContractTest` contract is used to convert Carrot tokens to USD tokens.;
The vulnerability of `CarrotToUST` function is that the contract address that is passed as the recipient in the `CarrotToUST` function is not checked, which can lead to a vulnerability of a token being sent to an unexpected contract.;
