The injected vulnerability should cause the following:;
1. A data breach attacker can submit a transaction to the contract without any prior confirmation or permission, allowing them to spend any amount of Ether. The attacker can then withdraw this Ether in a single transaction without any restriction.;
2. The attacker can submit a transaction with a random value (not necessarily a valid value) and then spend that amount of Ether.;
3. The attacker can submit a transaction with a random value (not necessarily a valid value) and then cancel that transaction, and then spend that amount of Ether.;
You can find the following vulnerability definition in the [Solidity Security Best Practices](https:
数据双花漏洞发生在数据缺乏唯一性验证，攻击者可以多次使用相同的数据进行交易。在数据交易中，攻击者可能通过该漏洞重复提交相同的数据交易，导致数据被多次售出或授权，造成交易的不一致性和资产损失。,
