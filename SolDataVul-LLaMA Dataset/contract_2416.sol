// Injected data-trading logic
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
contract DataContract {

    function dataPayment(address payable recipient, uint amount) public payable {
        require(msg.value >= amount, "Insufficient payment");
        recipient.transfer(amount);
        emit PaymentProcessed(msg.sender, recipient, amount);
    }
}
pragma solidity 0.8.12;

Here is a sample code for the contract and the corresponding solution:;
Contract:;

contract A {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender};
    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can transfer");
        require(amount > 0, "Invalid amount");
        balances[recipient] += amount;
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, recipient, amount)};
    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 amount)};
Solution:;

contract A {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender};
    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can transfer");
        require(amount > 0, "Invalid amount");
        balances[recipient] += amount;
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, recipient, amount)};
    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 amount)};
function duplicateSubmission(bytes memory signedData) public {
    externalContract.call(signedData)}
