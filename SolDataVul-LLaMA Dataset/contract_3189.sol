# 2. Deploy Contract;
Now that we have the vulnerable contract, we need to deploy it on a blockchain. For this, we'll use the following tools:;
## 2.1 Truffle;
Truffle is the most popular tool for developing and deploying smart contracts. We'll use Truffle to deploy our contract on a blockchain.;
## 2.2 Ganache;
Ganache is a local blockchain simulator for Ethereum. We'll use Ganache to run our local blockchain environment.;
## 2.3 Truffle-config.js;
Truffle-config.js is a configuration file for Truffle. In this file, we'll define the environment variables and other settings for our project.;
# 3. Run Tests;
Let's run some tests to check if our contract is vulnerable or not. We'll use Truffle for this.;
## 3.1 Truffle;
Truffle is a test-suite and development environment for Ethereum smart contracts. We'll use Truffle to run our tests.;
## 3.2 truffle-config.js;
Truffle-config.js is a configuration file for Truffle. In this file, we'll define the environment variables and other settings for our project.;
## 3.3 Vulnerability Tests;
Now that we have the vulnerable contract, let's write some tests for it. We'll use Truffle's testing framework to write these tests.;
## 3.4 Write Tests;
In this task, you need to write tests for the following vulnerabilities:;
* 时间戳依赖漏洞（TimeStampDependence）;
Please write the tests and inject the vulnerabilities into the contract.;
# 4. Inject Vulnerabilities;
Now that we have the vulnerable contract and its tests, let's inject the vulnerabilities.;
## 4.1 Inject TimeStampDependence;
Please inject the TimeStampDependence vulnerability into the contract.;
# 5. Run Tests Again;
Now that we've injected the vulnerabilities, let's run the tests again to check if our contract is vulnerable.;
## 5.1 Run Tests;
Please run the tests again using Truffle.;
## 5.2 Check Results;
Please check the results of the tests and confirm that the vulnerabilities have been injected successfully.;
# 6. Check Results;
Please check the results of the tests and confirm that the vulnerabilities have been injected successfully.;
## 6.1 Check Vulnerability;
Please check if the TimeStampDependence vulnerability has been injected successfully.;
# 7. Conclusion;
Please confirm that
